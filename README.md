# SqlProjects 
KhanAcademy/Relational queries in SQL

In this project , I am going to make my own table with the top 12 'famous people' in the world. then,create another table on what they do,their source of wealth,e.t.c and another table on any personal info,you'd might like to know about them.
I joined these tables together to create nice human readable list. 
The following concepts on joining data bases were applied : -SELFJOIN, OUTERJOIN & INNERJOIN.
